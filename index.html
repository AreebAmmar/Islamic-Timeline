The first pillar of Islam, the Shahadah (Declaration of Faith), affirms the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad.

It is performed five times a day—Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). These prayers serve as a reminder of faith, discipline, and devotion, strengthening the spiritual connection with the Creator. Each prayer consists of recitations from the Quran, including Surah Al-Fatiha, along with bowing (ruku) and prostration (sujood), symbolizing humility and submission to Allah.</div>

It requires Muslims to give 2.5% of their accumulated wealth annually to support the poor, orphans, widows, and those in need. Zakat purifies one’s wealth, promotes social justice, and ensures economic balance within the community. By fulfilling this obligation, Muslims strengthen their faith, develop empathy for the less fortunate, and contribute to a more compassionate society.

From dawn to sunset, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, and other physical needs, focusing on prayer, self-discipline, and spiritual reflection. Fasting teaches patience, gratitude, and empathy for those who struggle with hunger daily. It is a time for increased devotion, seeking forgiveness, and strengthening one’s connection with Allah.

It takes place in the month of Dhul-Hijjah and involves performing a series of rituals, including Tawaf (circling the Kaaba), Sa'i (walking between Safa and Marwah), and standing in prayer at Arafat. Hajj symbolizes unity, humility, and submission to Allah, bringing Muslims from all over the world together in worship and reflection.

            <div class="subcon4text">
                <h3>Purpose of Life</h3>
                <p>Islam teaches that the purpose of life is to worship Allah, seek knowledge, and do righteous deeds. We are placed on this earth as a trial, entrusted with free will to follow the path of guidance or turn away. Life is a temporary stage, a preparation for what is to come. The Quran states, <i>"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me" (Quran 51:56).</i></p>

                <h3>Good Deeds & Rewards</h3>
                <p>Every act of kindness, honesty, and devotion is recorded and will be rewarded beyond measure. Charity, prayer, and sincerity lead the soul towards eternal bliss. Acts of kindness, charity, and prayer lead to immense rewards in the Hereafter. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said, <i>"The best among you are those who bring the most benefit to others."</i></p>

                <h3>Sins & Consequences</h3>
                <p>Wrongdoings are not just momentary lapses but barriers that distance us from divine mercy. However, repentance and righteousness can erase even the gravest mistakes. Major sins such as arrogance, dishonesty, and oppression distance a person from Allah’s mercy. However, sincere repentance is always accepted by Allah.</p>

                <h3>Paradise (Jannah)</h3>
                <p>The ultimate reward—an abode of unimaginable peace, beauty, and eternal happiness. A place where rivers flow beneath gardens, palaces shine like pearls, and contentment never fades. Jannah is a place of eternal bliss, filled with unimaginable beauty. Allah says, <i>"No soul knows what delights are kept hidden for them" (Quran 32:17).</i></p>

                <p>Jahannam is a place of justice for wrongdoers. However, Allah’s mercy is vast, and those who repent can attain forgiveness. A severe warning—a place of consequence for those who reject truth and persist in wrongdoing. Its fire and suffering serve as a reminder that justice is inevitable.</p>
